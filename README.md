# Poverty Mapping with Remote Sensing and Machine Learning  

This repository documents my work and learning from the **Asian Development Bank (ADB) certification** on *Using Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Algorithms for Granular Estimation of Poverty*.  

The goal is to explore how **satellite imagery** and **machine learning models** can be used to generate fine-grained poverty estimates, supporting **evidence-based development policies** in climate-vulnerable and fragile contexts.  

---

## Context  
Poverty estimates are often limited to coarse survey data. Integrating **Earth Observation (EO) data** with **ML algorithms** allows policymakers to identify vulnerable populations at a much more granular level, improving disaster risk management and resilience planning.  

---

## Key Skills and Methods  
- **Remote Sensing & Geospatial Analysis**  
  - Extracting socioeconomic features from satellite imagery (e.g., night-time lights, vegetation indices).  
  - Preprocessing imagery for ML pipelines.  

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Supervised learning for poverty prediction.  
  - Feature engineering from EO and survey data.  
  - Model evaluation with cross-validation techniques.  

- **Data Integration**  
  - Combining geospatial imagery with survey and administrative datasets.  
  - Using poverty estimates to inform **development economics** and **disaster risk reduction**.  

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- **Geospatial**: QGIS, rasterio, geopandas  
- **Remote Sensing Data**: Sentinel, Landsat, night-time lights datasets

## Certification Reference  
- **Course:** *Using Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Algorithms for Granular Estimation of Poverty*  
- **Provider:** Asian Development Bank (ADB)  
- **Skills Earned:** Satellite imagery analysis, geospatial poverty mapping, ML for socioeconomic indicators  

---

## Future Directions  
- Extend analysis to combine **poverty maps with disaster risk indicators**.  
- Explore applications in **climate resilience**, **fragility assessments**, and **policy targeting**.  
- Integrate models with World Bank / UN geospatial platforms.
